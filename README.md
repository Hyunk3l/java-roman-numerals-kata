# java-roman-numerals-kata
Just another Roman Numerals TDD Kata done in Java.
*NOTE:* code is from a Sandro Mancuso's screencast you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZjgj1S0FCY).

Second part of the Kata (from roman to decimal) has been solved by me.

## How to run
Just run tests from IntelliJ Idea.
